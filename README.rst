Cheshire3 Team at the `University of Liverpool`_:

* Catherine Smith

(Current maintainer in **bold**)


Latest Version
--------------

Source code is under version control and available from:

http://github.com/cheshire3/istc

Development in the GitHub repository will follow (at least to begin with)
Vincent Driessen's branching model, and use `git-flow`_ to facilitate this.
For full details of the model, see:

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Accordingly, the ``master`` branch is stable and contains the most recent
release of the software; development should take place in (or by creating a
new ``feature/...`` branch from) the ``develop`` branch.


Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generate using the command::

    python setup.py build_sphinx


The generated HTML documentation can then be found in docs/build/html/.

All scripts intended for use by administrative users should return help when
passed the `--help` option.
