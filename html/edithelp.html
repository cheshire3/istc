<h1>ISTC Editing Interface</h1>

<p>Welcome to the new ISTC Editing interface. We hope that we have made significant improvements with this new interface
both in terms of design and functionality. There are a few features we would like to draw to the attention of those who 
have experience of using the old system as they work slightly differently now.</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the main new aspects to the system is the presence of a draft store for files in the process of being edited.
This means that you can save records that are only half created and come back to them later. It also means that once you
have finished with a record it is important that you submit it so that it can become part of the main database and 
be deleted from the draft file store. For more details see <a href="#submit">Submit Options</a></li>

<li>Another difference is that now you cannot delete a record from the main ISTC database from the editing form. Instead
there is a separate option on the main menu for deleting existing ISTC records. From the editing form itself you can only
discard a draft from your draft file store and not from the main database.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Editing Menu</h3>
<p>There are six options in the main editing menu</p>

<ul>
<li>Create New ISTC Entry</li>
<li>Edit Existing ISTC Entry</li>
<li>Delete Existing ISTC Entry</li>
<li>Add/Edit Bibliographical Reference Abbreviations</li>
<li>Add/Edit USA Location Abbreviations</li>
<li>Edit your User Account</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create/Edit an ISTC Record</h3>

<h4>Selecting a Record to Edit</h4>

<p>If you are editing an existing record there are several ways of selecting which record. 
<ul><li>To edit a record from the main 
database you can either start typing the ISTC number you are interested in in the top box and then select the correct number
from the list that appears or you can bring up a list of ISTC numbers alphabetically by clicking on the relevant letter 
and then selecting the appropriate number. You will not be allowed to edit a file which is already in the editing store.</li>
<li>To edit a record which has copy location data indicated as private select the record from the list in the second section
of the menu. You will not be allowed to edit a file which is already in the editing store.</li>
<li>To edit a file saved in your editing store select the file from the list in the third section of the form. You will be 
able to see the files other users have saved in their editing store but you cannot open them.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>The Editing Form</h4>

<p>The process for editing an existing record and creating a new one in the editing form is the same. 
Some fields such as ISTC number, author and title simply require completion or editing. How to complete 
fields which can have multiple entries are explained in the section on Multiple Entry Fields.</p>

<h4>File Options</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Save</b> - Saves the current file in the draft file store.</li>
<li><b>Discard Draft</b> - Deletes the current file from the draft file store. </li>
<li><b>Clear Form</b> - Removes all data from the current form (effectively starting a new record) but does not delete 
the existing file from the draft file store if it has been saved.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preview Options</h4>
<p>If you are creating a new record these options will only become available once the record has been saved for the 
first time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>XML</b> - See a preview of your record in MARC21XML the format used internally in Cheshire3.</li>
<li><b>MARC</b> - See a preview of your record in MARC ALEPH format.</li>
<li><b>Email Record</b> - Email a preview of your record in MARC ALEPH format to the email address registered to your user name.</li>
</ul>
<a name="submit"></a>
<h4>Submit Options</h4>
<p>If you are creating a new record these options will only become available once the record has been saved for the 
first time. These options move your files from the draft file store into the main database.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>To File</b> - This option adds the record to the database files and deletes it from the draft file store. It 
does not index the file so it will not be available for searching until the database is rebuilt by John Goldfinch. This
is the option you should use unless there is very good reason not to as it is the most reliable and quickest method.</li>
<li><b>Index and File</b> - This option adds the record to the database file and deletes it from the draft file store.
It also adds the record to the indexes so that it is available for searching immediately. If this is an edited record
it will replace the existing record in the indexes. This option may take some time especially if you are replacing an 
existing record and should only be used if it is important that the new data be available immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiple Entry Fields</h4>

<p>To add an entry into a multiple entry field (such as imprints, references and holdings) first complete the text 
boxes relevant to the field and then click "add". The entry will then move into the grey box at the bottom of the section
 and add it to the record.
</p>
<p>To edit an entry already added to a record click on the text of the entry and it will move into the text boxes. 
The entry in the grey box is replaced with a small grey arrow indicating that the entry will be added at that point
in the list when you click the add button.</p>
<p>If you are adding a new entry and want it to appear at a particular point in the list rather than at the bottom you
need to first click the insert above image <img src="/istc/images/insert.png"/> next to the record below the point at 
which you want to insert the new entry. </p>
<p>An entry can be deleted by clicking on the delete image <img src="/istc/images/remove.png"/> alongside the relevant
entry. Entries can also be moved up and down the list using the up image <img src="/istc/images/up.png"/> and the
down image <img src="/istc/images/down.png"/>.</p>

<h4>Special Characters</h4>

<p>Special characters can be added to your description using the character keyboard. The keyboard can be viewed by
clicking on the "character keyboard" link at the top of the form or the "keyboard" link between sections of the form.
Once the keyboard is visible it can be minimised, maximised and closed using the buttons on the title bar (just like
windows in most operating systems). There is a caps lock button on the keyboard which will switch the characters from 
lower case to upper case and back again.If the character you need is not available on the keyboard you may enter it
using its numerical encoding <b>&amp;#233;</b> for <b>&#233;</b> but not its named encoding (<b>&amp;eacute;</b>). </p>


<h3>Delete an Existing ISTC Record</h3>

<p>Here you can delete a current ISTC Record. You can select a record in one of two ways. Either you can 
start typing the ISTC number into the top box and you will then get some matching entries to select from 
or you can bring up a list of ISTC numbers alphabetically by clicking on the relevant letter and then ticking
the box next to the appropriate number/numbers. Using the latter option you can delete more than one record 
at a time if they belong under the same letter.</p>
<p>Whichever selection method you use there are two delete buttons. The button marked "delete" will delete
the record from the database but will not remove it from the indexes and therefore it will still appear
in the search and display until the database is next rebuilt (by John Goldfinch). The button marked "delete + unindex"
will delete the record from the database and from the indexes so it will disappear immediately and will not be searchable. 
This operation takes a little longer to perform than simply deleting.</p>

<h3>Edit or Add USA Locations or Bibliographical References</h3>

<p>The process for adding or editing a USA Location or a Bibliographical Reference is the same. In the box for the 
abbreviation you can type in the abbreviation you want to edit or add. If you are editing you can then select the 
appropriate abbreviation and the full text version will appear in the lower box and can be edited. If you are adding 
an abbreviation it is important to check that it doesn't already exist by checking the list that appears when you 
start typing in the abbreviation box. You can then add the full text to the lower box. To submit your changes or
additions click the submit button.</p>

<h3>Edit your user Account</h3>

<p>Here you can change details relating to your user account. To make any changes you need 
to enter your password in the box at the bottom. If you wish to change your password then 
you need to enter the new password in the new password boxes and your old password in the box
at the bottom. If you do not want to change your current password leave the new password boxes empty.</p>
